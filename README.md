# IT's A TrAp ⏢

IT's A TrAp ⏢ is a book about founder mistakes. We ask founders from many different industries, backgrounds, and perspectives to add to this book.

The truth is, mistakes help us learn. Learning from others will help you succeed.

---
# We ask the following questions:

### What was the biggest mistake you made as a founder?

### What lead up to that mistake?

### What was the outcome?

### How could it have been avoided?

### What did you learn?

---
# How you can contribute:

If you know a founder, ask them these questions. This book is open source (MIT), so anyone can contribute to the git repo.

We use mdBook for rendering markdown to html.
